Food for thought
Notes:
a. a pointer is a var that may contain the address of another var
  it's denoted by * (values of object pointed to) or & (memory address of the passed operand)
b. A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable.
c. enums are user-defined set of variables
d. An array is a contiguous collection of vars of omogeneous data type
e. A structure on the other hand (like tuples in other langs), is a collection of heterogenous data types
   - they don't necessarily have to be in a contiguous form
f. namespace: controls the visibility of names
g. list initialization denoted by "{}": prohibits implicit narrowing conversions
h. Deduction of type initializer denoted by "auto": (var in Java) infers the data type

Questions
1. If both int and long int hold 4 bytes of data, what's the difference b/n them?
2. In C++ variables are also referred to as objects, and types are referred to as classes. Why so?
